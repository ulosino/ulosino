# ULOSINO Tempo

Open source projects need financial support. This is a fact.

ULOSINO Tempo puts donation options at your fingertips. Visit the operating system's donation page, or go direct to external financial services with Quick Donation Options.

## Using ULOSINO Tempo

Operating systems that have Tempo enabled show a badge on the Operating System List and most search options.

Once you have found an operating system that offers Tempo, open it's Operating System Page and then select Donate. This will take you to the OS' Tempo options page.

The Tempo options page shows a link to access the operating system's donation page. Select this if you wish to view the full range of donation options that the project offers.

However, the Tempo options page also shows Quick Donation Options underneath. Quick Donation Options let you go directly to an assortment of donation platforms.

> **Note:** The availability of these options depends on the operating system project and the external services they use. For example, some projects prefer Open Collective while others prefer Liberapay.

## Disabling ULOSINO Tempo Features
