# Browser Compatibility

We recommended you use the latest version of popular web browsers to access ULOSINO.

We recommend:

- Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge versions 95.0 and later
- Safari versions 15.0 and later
- Mozilla Firefox versions 98.0 and later

> Mozilla Firefox doesn't plan to support the Progressive Web App standard, meaning that some ULOSINO features won't work when using Firefox.

The ULOSINO web app is compiled to the EcmaScript 2021 international standard. When you access ULOSINO, we automatically collect your browser web agent (to the extent of Technical Information, as defined in the ULOSINO Privacy Notice) to ensure you're using a browser that we know will correctly render and handle the application. Attempting to access ULOSINO using any version of the following browsers will show an error message:

- Internet Explorer
- Microsoft Edge Legacy
- Yandex Browser
