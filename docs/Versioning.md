# ULOSINO Versioning

At ULOSINO, we use the industry-standard semantic versioning scheme. (To summarise, that is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; where MAJOR includes breaking changes, MINOR includes features, and PATCH includes bug fixes or updates to Database Content).

Beginning with version `3.0.0`, we don't show a version string anywhere in the application. This is mainly because there isn't anywhere to put one (earlier versions included a contact page which has since been removed).

To get the latest version, visit our GitHub Releases changelog.

It is possible to get technical information on the deployment you're using. Pressing `Control+Shift+Backtick` or `Alt+Shift+Backtick` on Windows will dump useful deployment information to the browser's JavaScript console. Refer to the Keyboard Shortcut Reference for more information.
