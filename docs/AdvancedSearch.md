# Advanced Search

In addition to the Search box on Home, ULOSINO offers Advanced Search.

Advanced Search gives you 10 search options, based on ULOSINO's collection of metadata. This includes the platform and desktop environment all the way to the default shell (think `bash` or `zsh`).

## Opening Advanced Search

- On desktop, select Browse and then select Advanced Search.
- On mobile, select Advanced Search from the Menu.

> **Tip:** If you enable Use Advanced Search Link in Preferences, a link to advanced search will replace the Browse link.

> **Tip:** On non-Windows systems, you can open a new tab to Advanced Search using the keyboard shortcut `Control+Option+N`.

## Using Advanced Search

10 search options are available. They are grouped, as described below.

### Core Metadata Search

Core Metadata Search covers the basic properties of an open-source operating system.

- Name
- Platform
- Desktop
- Startup Manager
- Package Manager

> **Note:** The search cards here show the same details as the cards on the Operating System List. This includes key information, Tempo availability, and the category tag.

### Advanced Metadata Search

These are more niche categories but are included to help find a specific project with minimal clues.

- Derived Operating System (for example, entering Ubuntu would show Ubuntu derivatives)
- Region of Origin (not applicable for most projects)
- Shell (for example `bash` or `zsh`)

### ULOSINO System Search

These 2 search categories cover metadata which help ULOSINO organise itself.

- Category (the category noted in the blue tag)
- Summary (shown on the OS List and Core Metadata Search)
