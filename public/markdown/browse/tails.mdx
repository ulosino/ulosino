Tails, an acronym for "The Amnesic Incognito Live System", is a live USB Linux distribution based on Debian. It targets those within the general computing market who want to take their activities 'off-the-grid.' It uses Tor-based networking by default, includes a "digital security toolbox" of preinstalled software (including web browsers). All data generated during a log-in session is cleared upon shutdown or reboot. These unique features aren't seen elsewhere in the game - this distribution of Linux fulfils a big need in our modern era. The project points out charitable uses (escaping domestic violence, journalism, others) and endorsements from the EFF and Edward Snowden, among others. The actual Tails system - "your secure computer anywhere" - is like other OSs and it works like an otherwise normal operating system. The preinstalled software can be used for general uses as well.
