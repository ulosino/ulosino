Ubuntu is a Linux distribution. Created by Canonical, it aims to be "more than Linux" - Ubuntu targets the desktop, server, cloud, and enterprise markets. Besides this, Ubuntu is often seen as a "gold standard" within Linux distributions and has many derivitives and flavours. Ubuntu itself ships "all the essential applications", GNOME, and is a great desktop experience. Moreover, it's neutral and not very opinionated, suitable for general computing needs. Ubuntu is the most recognised open source OS, with Steam support for gaming, and many pre-installed office and productivity apps. Both Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server aim to get the job done, at any scale.
