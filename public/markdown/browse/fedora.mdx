Fedora is a Linux distribution. Created by Red Hat, it targets the developer, power-user, and server markets. The Workstation edition ships the GNOME 41 desktop and has been "created for developers", although this focus can be extended to other fields of productivity and work, like graphic design and word processing. "From hobbyists ... to professionals", Fedora is firmly in the work lane, coming pre-installed with office programs, virtualisation software, and the "complete open source toolbox." A Server edition is also available. Fedora is likely the ideal choice for those who need a Linux based system for work and productivity, and for those who appreciate the attributes associated with work - including reliability and compatibility with other software and other devices.
