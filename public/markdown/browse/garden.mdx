Garden Linux is an open-source OS designed for servers and virtual machine deployments. It targets the cloud and enterprise markets. Garden descends Debian and aims to be a "small, auditable" system, with "repeatable" builds. The releases and builds use a "feature system" and are tailored to different platforms (like AWS) and features. It's also built with CI in mind. The "whole setup is purely `systemd` based," including networking. Garden allows for Linux on a variety of deployment environments.
