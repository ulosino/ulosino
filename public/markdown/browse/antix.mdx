antiX is a Linux distribution based off Debian. It targets the lightweight market. antiX runs in the RAM of a computer and only operates on a USB drive - good for older systems and self-proclaimed as "antiX Magic." It ships a minimal amount of software for this to work. However it does allow for customisation and internet connectivity - the essentials. These solutions and "innovations" make antiX a popular choice for saving an otherwise inoperable PC.
