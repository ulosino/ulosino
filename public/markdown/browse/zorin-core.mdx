Zorin OS is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu and made for desktop use. Marketed to compete against Windows and macOS, it targets the general computing and enterprise/education (through it's Zorin Grid product) markets. Also notable about it's marketing is its distancing from Linux ("available with Ubuntu, Linux, and Windows apps"). Shipping a heavily modified GNOME desktop by default it aims to be a "desktop you already know how to use", aiming to allow "a world of ... apps" and games. It also aims to "make your computer faster" - PCWorld claims that "this is where [it] really shines." A Lite version is also available for older computers, using Xfce so to cut down the system requirements.
