UBPorts is Linux distribution for mobile devices. Forked from the now discontinued (and deprecated) Ubuntu Touch OS developed by Canonical, it targets tinkerers and power-users. It wants to make you "feel free," the "story of a global community" delivers the essentials for one's portable computing needs. Unlike regular Ubuntu, it allows you to place a phone call, send a carrier-managed SMS, or snap selfies using the Camera app (either front or back, multi-camera setups aren't supported), among other things. It ships an Android-like GUI and is powered by web apps, a bit like (the also deprecated) Firefox OS by Mozilla.
