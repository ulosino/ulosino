MidnightBSD is a BSD operating system forked from FreeBSD version 6.1. It targets the general computing market. The MidnightBSD project mostly works on the frontend, going beyond the server elements of FreeBSD. The project believes that scheduling and "available application support should be tailored to desktop users." MidnightBSD plans to implement a custom log-in manager and centralising system preferences in continuing to diffrentiate itself from FreeBSD.
