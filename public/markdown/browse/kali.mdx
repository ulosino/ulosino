Kali Linux is a Linux distribution that descends the testing channel of Debian. It targets developer and enterprise markets. Kali is oriented as a "advanced penetration" Linux distribution that comes preinstalled with a variety of tools for forensic science, reverse engineering, and general security-related activities (Wireshark, Hydra, Maltego, others). Kali ships the Xfce desktop by default, with an "Undercover Mode" Windows-like visual overlay (as to "not stand out in the crowd"). Kali Linux is available on x86 and arm systems, for installation or as a live USB, along with containers, VMs, cloud, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
