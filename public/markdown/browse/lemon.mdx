Lemon OS is an independent Unix-like OS. A "hobbyist" OS, it targets the power-user market. Lemon is written in C++. It implements a "modular kernel," symmetric multiprocessing multitasking subsystems, and UNIX- and BSD-like sockets. A networking stack is preinstalled as well. The custom LemonWM window manager powers the included desktop environment.
