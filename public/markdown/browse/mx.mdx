MX Linux is a Linux distribution. Targeting general computing, the desktop-oriented OS "family" are designed to bring "stability and strong performance." It ships the Xfce desktop as it's "flagship" (like Fedora and GNOME), many "MX Tools" utility apps, and an "extensive collection" of customisation options. It also aims to support older hardware as well.
