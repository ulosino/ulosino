Xubuntu is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu. It targets the general computing market. Like Kubuntu, Xubuntu replaces GNOME's role in Ubuntu with the Xfce desktop. The Xubuntu project aims to provide the "elegance and ease of use" provided by the Xfce desktop in a "good balance" of appearance and system performance/resource management.
