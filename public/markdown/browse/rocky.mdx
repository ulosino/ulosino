Rocky Linux is a Linux distribution based off the Red Hat platform. "A community-driven effort" to deliver "enterprise-grade production-ready Linux," it targets the enterprise and corporate markets. It was initially forked from Red Hat Enterprise Linux and competes against it for market share. Rocky ships the GNOME desktop and the typical GNOME suite of pre-installed software, allowing for use out-of-the-box (similar to Fedora Server). Rocky is a new distribution, founded by the same founder of (the discontinued) CentOS after it "shifted direction." It aims to climb the mountains of giants but has backers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
