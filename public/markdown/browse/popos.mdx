Pop!\_OS is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu. Targeting STEM, education, and creativity, Pop features a modified GNOME 41 desktop with many windowing enhancements, and includes many developer "toolkits" (including AI, engineering, media). It has a focus on security with full disk encryption by default. It's developed by system76 and ships on many of their hardware products. Pop!\_OS doesn't exactly intrude on one's workflow but nevertheless has quite a character - more than logos - which is something lacking by others in the game. Pop!\_OS is a good all-rounder, especially for work and creativity.
