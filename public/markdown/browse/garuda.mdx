Garuda Linux is an Linux distribution based on the Arch platform. It targets the power-user and general computing markets. Garuda extends Arch by implementing multiple stability and security features like custom memory management, custom kernel scheduling, the Linux-zen modified kernel, and the "modern copy-on-write" BTRFS file system. The aim is to provide an OSs that is focussed on "performance while making it beautiful," as there are many GUI utilities, including a graphical installation - a major draw card for who prefer Arch.
