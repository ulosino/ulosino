elementary is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu and made for desktop use. Marketed as a "thoughtful and capable ... replacement for Windows and macOS", it targets the general computing market. It brings the Pantheon desktop (modified GNOME) and a "pay what you want" app platform known as "AppCenter." It has `flatpak` support. Elementary also comes out of the box with email ("Mail") and media ("Photos", "Videos", "Music") applications, although it does aim to ship a bloat-free product. Elementary, despite it's name, has the full team in pack and ready for your average computing needs.
