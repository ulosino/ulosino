EndeavourOS is a Linux distribution based off Arch. Targeting power-users, the "terminal-centric" OS ships a "minimal and flexible" Arch system with broad customisation capabilities. Like Arch, it is distributed using rolling release model. Like Arch, Endeavour gives you the options you'll need to "create" your own OS. In the words of the Endeavour team, that means that it "isn't an expressway to a predefined destination." Endeavour is for those who wish to take their time and tweak everything with precision - but with guidance.
