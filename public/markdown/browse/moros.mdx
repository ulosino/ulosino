MOROS, an acronym for Obscure Rust Operating System, is an independent operating system. It targets the developer and power-user markets. It takes a new approach to the core OS and is a part of a growing movement - moving the core system code away from C and Assembly and writing in Rust. The Rust language is developed by Mozilla and is a part of the C family of languages. Using Rust means instantly implementing great memory management, modern resource allocation, and other modern language features. In it's current form, MOROS has a "basic filesystem" and support for "basic file and network commands". MOROS works on 64-bit x86 platforms using legacy BIOS technology. It "also runs well on most emulators." Support for USB and UEFI has been suggested but would "increase the complexity of the project." The included shell is custom.
