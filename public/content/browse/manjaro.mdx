Manjaro is an Arch-based Linux distribution. Targeting general computing and power-users, Manjaro is a "professionally made" OS aiming to be a replacement to Windows or macOS. It takes the rolling-release platform of Arch but goes for "less manual intervention." Manjaro ships Xfce by default - with many other desktops available - has broad hardware support, is ready out-of-the-box, and shoots for a "traditional UNIX philosophy." However, more advanced features like concurrent kernels are also available.
