Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution. Targeting power users, it ships a command line interface. Alpine is designed for those who "appreciate security, simplicity, and resource efficiency" and has a wide array of applications in the server, container, and VM industries. Alpine also ships with a custom software repository called apk ("Alpine Package Keeper"). It's available on x86, arm, and risc-v, and legacy platforms including PowerPC and even IBM's System/390 - it's server roots are apparent; it requires Ethernet for a wizard-based setup (the de facto standard). Alpine only provides the total basics (not even `nano`), which is something quite unique.
