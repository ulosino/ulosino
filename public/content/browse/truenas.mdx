[TrueNAS CORE](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/) is a BSD operating system, forked from FreeBSD. Like it's name suggests, it is a network attached storage host operating system - it targets the general computing and power-user markets. Self-described as the "most popular storage OS," TrueNAS CORE aims to deliver a "professional-grade storage system." TrueNAS CORE includes the "self-healing" OpenZFS file system and RAID support out of the box, and can be used on x86 hardware or can be run inside a virtual machine. Data compression is also built-in. The OS uses text-based installation but can be managed later using a remote web-based interface. TrueNAS CORE also has an enterprise-grade sibling, known as TrueNAS Enterprise.
