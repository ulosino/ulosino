oasis is an independent Linux distribution, with considerable BSD characteristics. "An ambitions project," it targets the power-user market. oasis is new to the scene; the "principles" here are "statically linked executables," simple file-based system configuration (within `/etc`), and overall modularity. oasis has no package management by default but "integrates well with OS-agnostic" repositories like `pkgsrc` (from NetBSD) and `nix`. A major feature here is a Lua-powered build system that shifts away from direct maintanence to "considerable up-front packaging cost." Pre-installed software are assorted into "sets" that can be easily managed.
