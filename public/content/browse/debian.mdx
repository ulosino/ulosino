Debian is a mature Linux distribution. Marketed as "The Universal Operating System," it targets the general computing market. It's considered stable, with a biannual release scheme, in addition to LTS releases. This is actually the main reason why many distributions decend from Debian, like notable names including Ubuntu. Debian ships the Advanced Package Tool ('apt') as it's package management system. It's been a long time consumer of the GNOME desktop, including version 2. Debian is a classic example of the Linux distribution model, dating back to the start of the millennium.
