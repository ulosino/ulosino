[GhostBSD](http://ghostbsd.org) is a BSD operating system derived from FreeBSD. It targets the general computing market. It's a "simple desktop-oriented" system with "a selection of commonly used software preinstalled." The aim here is to "simplify FreeBSD" but also to "lower the entry-level" and "make it easy." GhostBSD ships the traditional MATE desktop, along with an assortment of internet and office software.
