Ubuntu Studio is an official flavour of Ubuntu. It targets the power-users, developer, and creativity markets. Like the name suggests, it includes an assortment of pre-installed software "for creative people." Leading open source graphics and video editing (Inkscape, Blender, Openshot), photography (GIMP, Darktable), desktop publishing (Calibre, Scribus), and audio processing (Ardour, Jack) applications come pre-installed. The project also aims to deliver tools for both beginners and professionals. Ubuntu Studio ships the Xcfe desktop in it's LTS.
