[Tails](https://tails.boum.org), an acronym for "The Amnesic Incognito Live System", is a live USB Linux distribution based on Debian. It targets those within the general computing market who want to take their activities 'off-the-grid.' It uses Tor-based networking by default, includes a "digital security toolbox;" with all data generated during a log-in session is cleared upon shutdown or reboot. These unique features aren't seen elsewhere in the game - this distribution of Linux fulfils a big need in our modern era. The actual Tails system - "your secure computer anywhere" - is like other OSs and it doesn't feel like you're off-the-grid. The projects points out charitable uses (escaping domestic violence, journalism, others) and endorsements from the EFF and Edward Snowden, among others. Nevertheless, with a live system like Tails, it only takes your USB stick to feel the power.
