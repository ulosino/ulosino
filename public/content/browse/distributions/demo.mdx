This is a demo for the distribution page system. **This isn't a distro.**

This page is written with Markdown (specifically remote MDX), which allows contributors to write in simple text and have the rest done by a computer. The rest involves compilation into complex JavaScript, which is in turn compiled by the core stack into HTML. See the <Link href="https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/STACK.md">STACK reference</Link> for more on remote MDX.

This page mainly exists for testing purposes. It indicates the ULOSINO distribution database is active and the backend is intact.
