[Q4OS](https://q4os.org) is a Linux distribution that descends Debian. It targets the power-user, developer, and enterprise markets. Q4OS "eliminates superfluous components and applications," while shipping "dedicated utilities." It allows for a dual-desktop setup ("typically" Plasma and Trinity) and being "tailored to one's individual preferences." Q4OS' low system requirements and lightweight Trinity desktop option also make it appealing for older computers.
