[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) is a mature BSD-based OS. First released in 1995, it targets both the general and server (notably networking) markets. FreeBSD has a loyal fanbase and aims to be a "complete operating system" so to "relize the full potential of any computer". Much of the work that happens with FreeBSD is at the core of the OS, with many innovations in the I/O, TCP/IP (Internet), LLVM, and subsystem fields. Well known for this innovative stance (in addition to it's strong foundation), it has formed the base for Netflix servers, PlayStation system software, and Apple products (through macOS and Darwin) across the world. John Baldwin, a FreeBSD developer for 25 years running, has said that it is both "phenomenal" and "bizzare" that his "son's PS4 runs [his] code all the time." The lasting footprint that the FreeBSD project has given to the world is certainly quite large.
