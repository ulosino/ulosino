[Garden Linux](https://gardenlinux.io) is an open-source OS designed for servers and virtual machine deployments. It targets the cloud and enterprise markets. Garden descends Debian and aims to be a "small, auditable" system, with "repeatable" builds. The releases and builds use a "feature system" and are tailored to different platforms (like AWS) and features. It's also built with CI in mind. The "whole setup is purely systemd based," including networking. Garden allows for Linux on a variety of deployment environments.
