DragonFly BSD is a BSD operating system forked from FreeBSD version 4.8. It targets the developer and power-user markets. The DragonFly project mostly works on the backend, modifing the already strong BSD kernel with a kernel that can "autotune" itself to "extreme levels", a "split" scheduling abstraction, a custom file system that has the will to handle an exobyte. That file system, dubbed "HAMMER," also supports streaming and emphasises high stability.
