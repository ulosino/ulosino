OpenBSD is a BSD operating system, based on BSD 4.4. OpenBSD targets the developer and power-user markets. Working on a biannual release scheme, OpenBSD is of the three founding BSD 4.4 derivatives (including FreeBSD and NetBSD). A "developer-oriented" project, OpenBSD takes a minimalist approach to BSD, emphasising portability, cryptography, and "correctness." The project is also attempting to create the "most secure operating system. However the OS is often considered to be to rigid for those new to Unix.
