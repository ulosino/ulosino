[Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org) is an official flavour of Ubuntu. It targets the general computing market. It combines the base of Ubuntu with a traditional desktop experience provided by the MATE desktop. The performance gains of MATE makes "modern computers fast and older computers usable." Like Ubuntu Studio, it uses the LTS release. Another major feature that this performance provides is great support of the Raspberry Pi and GPD platforms - for those on these arm-powered systems, the power of Ubuntu stability while keeping it usable is empowering.
