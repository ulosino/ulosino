[elementary](https://elementary.io) is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu and made for desktop use. Marketed as a "thoughtful and capable ... replacement for Windows and macOS", it targets the general computing market. It brings the Pantheon desktop (modified GNOME) and a "pay what you want" app store ("AppCenter") with flatpak support. Elementary also comes out of the box with email ("Mail") and media ("Photos", "Videos", "Music") applications, although it does aim to ship a bloat-free product. Elementary, despite it's name, has the full team in pack and ready for your average computing needs.
