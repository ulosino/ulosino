[KDE neon](https://neon.kde.org) is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu. Developed by KDE, it targets general computing and developers, and is the flagship of the KDE software ecosystem. It collates the KDE Plasma desktop, with the "greatest from the KDE community," while being at the "intersection of ... stable Ubuntu." neon also aims to ship a "rock-solid base" for stability as well. Testing and Developer editions suppliment the general User Edition and are intended for the development of KDE applications and libraries.
