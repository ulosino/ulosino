[SystemRescue](https://system-rescue.org) is an Linux distribution derived from Arch. Like it's name suggests, it's intended to repair a computer in the event of a serious system failure. It targets the general computing market. As a live OS, it can be easily flashed onto a USB stick or burned onto a CD/DVD to provide "an easy way to carry out admin tasks on a computer." Basic software like text editors and disk management software is included (GNU Parted, Memtest, ddrescue, others). Networking is available as well. A wide assortment of both local and network file systems are supported, such as Samba. All available graphically through the Xfce desktop, SystemRescue is an attractive option when in the worst of circumstances.
