[Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) is an independent Linux operating system. It targets the power-user and enterprise markets. The "heart" of Gentoo is the custom Portage package manager. Portage is unique when compared to other Linux package systems, and is probably closer to BSD software port collection. Portage builds a custom version of the software to the system specification and "ensuring optional features" are handled correctly. The "near-unlimited adaptability" delivered by Portage makes Gentoo foreign for many users, but also allowed for a "top-notch" and dedicated community. It also allows for usage from a "development workstation" or a "secure server" all the way to an "embedded solution" and mission-critical applications. A high degree of customisation and configuration, along with performance, are additional goals of the Gentoo project. Gentoo delivers ultimate control to those who want it and those who have learnt it.
