[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is an independent Linux distribution. It targets the power-user and developer markets. The main feature here is Nix, a "purely functional package manager" where packages are "treated like values in ... Haskell." Nix scraps the typical package folders like `/usr`, `/opt`, `/bin`, and `/sbin` and replaces it with `/nix/store`, with packages prepended with a cryptographic "package identifier". This "unique" and unconventional approach is the result of a long research phase, allowing features like rollbacks, "garbage collection," and multi-version and multi-user package management. NixOS combines this with the KDE Plasma desktop by default and `systemd` to create a cohesive and usable operating system.
