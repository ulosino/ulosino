[Nitrux](https://nxos.org) is a Linux distribution based on Debian. It targets the general computing market. Nitrux combines a long-term release of the popular Debian operating system and the KDE ecosystem. The included NX Desktop is customised Plasma. A "great selection" of "carefully picked" software, including LibreOffice and "audio and media players" are preinstalled. Firewall and backup software is also included. Nitrux heavily focusses on AppImage to deliver software - although the traditional `apt` package manager is accessible - and is built using a new and custom cross-platform (Android and Linux) user interface framework known as MauiKit (similar to Apple Inc's AppKit). Nitrux continues to diverge from Debian by using `openrc` instead of `systemd`. A CLI-based "alternative minimal ISO image" is provided for those who want to build on this custom base.
