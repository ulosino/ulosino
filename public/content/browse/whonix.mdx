[Whonix](https://www.whonix.org) is an Debian based Linux distribution. It targets the power-user market. It's a live operating system focussed on security, a bit like Tails. Whonix, as an operating system ("Whonix-Workstation") connects to the "Whonix-Gateway" set of voluteer-run virtual machines. The workstation (OS) intended as the place to run Tor - from there traffic is routed through the Tor network and the VM, and then onto the Internet. Other security hardening exists, like enhancements to the kernel. Whonix can only be run in a virtual machine, further hardening security. Whonix has more protections than competitors, but has a steeper learning curve and complexity.
