[EuroLinux](https://en.euro-linux.com/eurolinux/) is a Linux distribution based off Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It targets the enterprise market. A "serious" and "fully professional product," EuroLinux is a competitor to RHEL and the popular - but now discontinued - CentOS, and offers easy migration from those systems. "Tested on a massive scale," quality and enterprise support are major goals for the team of developers at EuroLinux. EuroLinux is free, without the mentioned support, and is available on AWS and Google Cloud.
