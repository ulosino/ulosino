[openSUSE Leap](https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap) is the regular fixed-release Linux distribution developed by enterprise software company SUSE. It mainly targets power-users and developers, with a wide choice of desktops, configuration options, and utilities. However it does aim to be the "most usable Linux distribution" for "new and experienced Linux users." It inherits source code from SUSE Linux Enterprise.
