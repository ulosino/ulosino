# Folders &amp; Files

First deployed in 1969, the file system on Unix and Unix-like operating systems has evolved over time and may be complex for the average user to understand. While you shouldn't be using most of these folders regularly, this Guide attempts to explain folder specific purposes and other such things.

In the table below, an overview of the Unix file system layout and it's files (more on that later). Also compared are the approximated locations of similar folders on Windows and macOS. '/' indicates the root (start) of the disk.
