[openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed) is a tested rolling-release Linux distribution developed by enterprise software company SUSE. Targeting power-users and developers, it aims to increase adoption of the Linux operating system. It contrasts openSUSE Leap in that it provides the newest software - but it has gone through testing and thus maintains reliability. It comes pre-installed with software that also targets power-users and software developers. Tumbleweed is best used for this market and may not be the most general in scope.
