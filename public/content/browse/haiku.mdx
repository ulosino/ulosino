[Haiku](https://haiku-os.org) is an open-source OS in beta targeting the general computing market. "Inspired by the BeOS," it is fully independent and has a loyal fanbase. Haiku ships a custom desktop (there is no CLI boot mode) with full drag-and-drop and a 'tab' style organisation feature. It aims to be "simple to use ... yet very powerful." Under the hood one will find a unique system with a fully-threaded custom kernel, object-oriented API, and a database-like file system. There is also a dedicated ecosystem of Haiku software as well. Haiku shows that while new technology may take decades to grow (hardware support is still a mixed bag), there will always be an underdog with a different approach - and it will usually succeed through both curiosity and research.
