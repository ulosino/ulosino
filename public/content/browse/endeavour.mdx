[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com) is a Linux distribution based off Arch. Targeting power-users, the "terminal-centric" OS ships a "minimal and flexible" Arch system with broad customisation capabilities. Like Arch, it's a rolling release. The product bleeds Arch, with the many utilities - you'll have to "create" your own OS. In the words of the Endeavour team, this means that it "isn't an expressway to a predefined destination." Endeavour is for those who wish to take their time and tweak everything with precision - but with padding and cushions.
