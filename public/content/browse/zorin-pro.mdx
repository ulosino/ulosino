[Zorin OS Pro](https://zorin.com/os/pro/) is an expanded version of the Linux distribution based off Ubuntu. At around December 2021, it costs $39 (USD, subject to conversion). Like it's free sibling Zorin OS (also called "Zorin OS Core") it targets the general computing and enterprise/education markets. It uses the "advanced" GNOME desktop and its suite of frameworks, with Pro shipping with many desktop "appearances" mimicking Windows 11, "classic" Windows (10, 7, and earlier), macOS, and Ubuntu. The "lightweight" Xcfe desktop from the Lite version is also available in Pro. Pro is primarily diffrentiated by it's inclusion (pre-installation) of "advanced productivity software", although this is "optional" with a "minimal installation." Nevertheless, Zorin OS Pro mainly acts as an easy way to support the "independent" Zorin company, "finance ... operations," with some extra perks sprinkled in.
