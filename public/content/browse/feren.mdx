[Feren OS](https://feren.weebly.com) is a distribution of Linux based off the Ubuntu LTS. It targets the general computing market. Feren ships the Plasma desktop, with some small modifications, and can tap into the "whole world of applications" offered by Ubuntu. Feren uses Vivaldi as it's preinstalled browser, includes a "Web Browser Manager" to change this, includes a custom onboarding experience, and aims to bring a distribution that "stays out of your way" to the game. Automatic updates are also included. As a complete package, Feren offers an easy path from those switching from Windows or ChromeOS to Linux.
