[UBPorts](https://ubports.com) is Linux distribution for mobile devices. Forked from the now disontinued (and deprecated) Ubuntu Touch OS developed by Canonical, it targets tinkerers and power-users. It wants to make you "feel free," the "story of a global community" delivers the essentials for one's portable computing needs. Unlike regular Ubuntu, it allows you to place a phone call, send a carrier-managed SMS, or snap pictures using the Camera app (either back or front, multi-camera setups not supported), among other things. It ships an Android-like GUI and is powered by web apps, a bit like (the also deprecated) Firefox OS by Mozilla.
