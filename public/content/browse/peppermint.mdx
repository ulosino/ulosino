[Peppermint OS](https://peppermintos.com) is a Linux distribution derived from Debian. Marketed as "good-to-go", it targets the general computing market. Aiming for lightweight experience, it delivers the LXDE desktop and the Nemo file manager. Another major attraction and differential feature is a focus and software integration with web apps, putting them "on an equal footing" with classic desktop software. Other notable features include automatic updates and comprehensive customisation features.
