This is a demo for the distribution page system. **This isn't a distro.**

This page is written with Markdown (specifically remote MDX), which allows contributors to write in simple text and have the rest done by a computer. The rest involves compilation into complex JavaScript, which is in turn compiled by the core stack into HTML. See the [STACK.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/STACK.md) for more on remote MDX.

As metadata dates this file prior to launch, it should be at the end of the Just In list.

This page mainly exists for testing purposes. It indicates the ULOSINO distribution database is active and the backend is intact.
