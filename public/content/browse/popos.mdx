[Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system72.com) ("Pop") is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu. Targeting STEM, education, and creativity, Pop features a modified GNOME 41 desktop with many windowing enhancements, ability to use many developer "toolkits" (including AI, engineering, media). It has a focus on security with full disk encryption by default. It's developed by system76 and ships on many of their hardware products. Pop!\_OS doesn't exactly intrude on one's workflow but nevertheless has quite a character - more than logos - which is something lacking by others in the game. However, for those looking to use their system for things that isn't productivity, Pop is narrow in scope and may not accomodate all of one's needs.
