Kubuntu is a Linux distribution based off Ubuntu. Combining the KDE Plasma desktop environment with the popular Ubuntu distribution, it targets the general computing market. The goal here is "making your computer friendly." Kubuntu delivers the KDE ecosystem of software - from this perspective, its like KDE neon but with the foundation, the hardware compatibility features, and the long term support (using biannual LTS releases) offered by Ubuntu.
