[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), widely abbreviated as 'RHEL', is a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat, a subsidiary of IBM. Like its name suggests, it targets the enterprise market. RHEL is available on bare-metal, but also in containers and in the cloud. The product allows for the deployment of applications and software within enterprises and other corporate settings. It ships the GNOME desktop by default. RHEL is based off another Linux distribution developed by Red Hat, the developer-focussed Fedora. Forks of RHEL developed by others also exist.
