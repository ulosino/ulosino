[Void](https://voidlinux.org) is an independent, "written from scratch" Linux distribution. It targets the power-user and developer markets. A stability-oriented rolling release powered by CI, it allows for both binary and source packages using an in-house package management system, called XBPS. The XBPS package builder, `xbps-src`, is also custom. Void uses a text based installation and a command line interface.
