[NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org) is an independent BSD operating system. It targets the power-user and enterprise markets. First released in 1993, over the Internet (hence the name), NetBSD aims to create a minimal but "fully-integrated UNIX-like system" that is "in many ways traditional." However the project also implements many modern features including ZFS and LVM storage capabilities, Xen and native NVMM virtualisation, and a modern software repository, NetBSD's `pkgsrc`. A big attraction is the wide variety of support platforms, including arm and specialised platforms like PowerPC, SPARC, mips, 68K, and many others. NetBSD uses a rolling release style of package management.
