[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) is a mature Linux distribution descending from Ubuntu. Targeting the general computing market, especially Windows users, Linux Mint aims to work "OOTB" ("out-of-the-box"), which means that it comes "fully eqipped with the apps most people need." Linux Mint uses the Cinnamon desktop by default; it includes a taskbar, Windows 7 style start menu, and an icon-based desktop. For many indeed, the self-proclaimed "friendly" desktop gives them everything they could want. However, for some the newer web-based workflow is more appropriate and therefore a lighter, more agile OS may fit their needs better.
