[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), often called 'Arch', is an independent Linux distribution. "Lightweight and flexible," it targets "competent users," power-users, and developers. It does not _prefer_ any desktop, among other things, requiring self-configuration - not many defaults. It ships a home-grown package manager, known as the `pacman` system. There's lots of software to choose from. Arch is designed for those who want to tweak their way through issues and try to find the "right" fit.
