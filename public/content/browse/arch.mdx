Arch Linux, often called 'Arch', is an independent Linux distribution. "Lightweight and flexible," it targets "competent users," power-users, and developers. The project doesn't prefer any desktop environment, with this strategy extending to other programs and software, requiring self-configuration. In other words, Arch doesn't have many defaults. It ships a home-grown package manager, known as the `pacman` system. There's lots of software to choose from. Arch is designed for those who want to hack and tweak their way through issues and try to find the "right" fit.
