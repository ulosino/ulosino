# Definitions

When you're using ULOSINO, you'll probably come across some unfamiliar terms. This page will teach you the lexicon.

**Architecture (x86, arm, RISC, 32-bit, 64-bit)** This refers to core design of the CPU (or System-on-Chip) and it's methods of communications (instruction set). Code is not interoperable between architectures, with rare exceptions. 'x86' and 'arm' are the most common architectures. Traditional 'x86' processors are common in desktop and laptop computers. 'arm' (Advanced RISC Machine) are low on energy consumption, suitable for mobile. 32-bit architectures are legacy platforms that use 32 bits (rather than 64) to store data (integers).

**Alpha &amp; Beta** This refers to the software development lifecycle. Alpha software is well before release (premature) and beta software usually contains most of the features, although some may be buggy. Use stable releases to ensure stability and security.

**BSD &amp; Linux** This refers to the BSD-decendents and Linux (which most software on this website is based off) respectively. Both decended from Unix and are Unix-like, however they aren't interoperable, with exceptions. Apple Inc.'s macOS (and it's decendents) is derived from BSD (Unix-like), but uses mostly proprietary software.

**Kernel** The kernel is the core of the operating system. It communicates with hardware, schedules processes and handles fatal errors. 'Monolithic' kernels (including Linux and BSD) integrate large masses of code into the kernel, while 'microkernels' offload most tasks out of the kernel (into user mode) so that they are modular, at the expense of performance. A 'hybrid' model attempts to integrate the best of both concepts.

**Kernel Panic** A kernel panic is a response to (rare) fatal errors (where the system can no longer safely operate). Debugging information may appear on the display (requiring a manual restart) or the system may restart automatically. On Windows platforms, the equivalent is a 'stop error' (BSOD).

**Operating System (OS)** The operating system is a large software stack, with many utilities, pre-installed software, background tools (daemons), that makes modern software work. You could think of it like the foundation of modern software; the better the foundation, the heavier (bigger and better) the software you use can (and will) be.

**Packages, Repositories, and Rolling Release** Packages are collections of files that form software, managed by a package manager. These are hosted on repositories, large database of software. 'Rolling release' operating system releases that uses steady ('rolling') releases of individual packages, rather than a bundle of updates as a larger OS release.

**User Interface (Terminal, GUI)** This refers to the way you'll interact with the system (the user interface). In a terminal environment, you'll be using a shell to pass text-based commands to the system. It's often used in lightweight or server operating systems or for administrative work. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) uses visual metaphors like menus, windows, and other such elements. These elements are rendered by a window server.

**Superuser** The superuser (or 'root') is an internal user account with full control over the system. It can delete system files, view the contents of other user accounts, etc. In the terminal shell, a command can run using the superuser by prepending it with 'sudo'. Caution should be taken when using the superuser.
