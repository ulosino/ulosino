# ULOSINO

## New platform

This is ULOSINO on an experimental platform. We expect to deliver this as `3.0.0` around the middle of March.

**It's currently in alpha** and isn't being versioned yet.

## Ethos

ULOSINO is wouldn't be possible without using modern technologies on an open source platform.

Our ambition is to make the hard easy. We've made discovering open source operating systems easy. We've made recommending open source operating systems easy with ULOSINO Matches. Plus, give capital with ULOSINO Tempo.

Behind the simplistic facade, you'll discover innovative and powerful features. 15-way search using metadata categories. Instant sorting. Reliable keyboard shortcuts.

Under the hood, ULOSINO runs a Next.js application with PWA web app functionality. Our PWA libraries deliver automatic content caching and offline capability. The key Ingredient here is MDX, which is based on Markdown. Together with our free licensing model, this allows anyone to contribute changes to our rich collection of OS pages. (In fact, we make it easy; open an OS and click "View on GitHub"). It also allows us to deliver performance and consistency at scale. Even though we've only programmed 14 pages, we deploy around 150 pages. Ultimately, this leads to the faster implementation of features and bug fixes.
