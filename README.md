## How it works

1. Contributors create a commit to edit some Database Content;
2. The new package of Database Content is collected (with metadata and all) by the Source Code (at build), and;
3. Then the new build is shipped off to the user!

Read through [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

ULOSINO, as a whole stack, is divided into Database Content (`/public`) and the Source Code (`/src`), which live together on a modern Next.js application.

Contributions to the source are welcomed as well. Reference [STACK.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/STACK.md) for an overview of the ULOSINO stack.
