## How It Works

1. Database Content is edited, in the easy-to-use Markdown format, as a part of a commit, and;
2. Then the Database Content is processed by the Source Code and deployed using GitHub Actions and the Vercel platform to visitors across the world.

## Why?

We think that open source operating system software allows people and businesses to do more with less. Linux and other open source solutions are cheaper, more private, and more secure. A good example of this is cost; it is a major barrier for those in developing markets - being able to connect direct to the rest of the world is key to reducing poverty and improving living conditions for tens of millions of people around the world.

Different people and teams have different ways to approach cost, privacy, security, and ease of use. This fact leads to so many choices and many different operating systems being built and released into the wild. We believe that having a modern setting to explore the vast world of open source operating systems is essential for the adoption of open source OSs over the short- to medium-term in developing markets where internet coverage is poor and access is expensive.

Having access to a computer and internet connection really can be life changing. This is one of the reasons why The Friendly Flow provides ULOSINO Tempo donation options. The continuous evolution of the open source operating system ecosystem is what allows for growth, both for the open source OS market share and for the individual self.

## Technical Ethos

ULOSINO is wouldn't be possible without using modern technologies on an open source platform.

Our ambition is to make the hard easy. We've made discovering open source operating systems easy. We've made recommending open source operating systems easy with ULOSINO Matches. Plus, give capital with ULOSINO Tempo.

Behind the simplistic facade, you'll discover innovative and powerful features. 10-way search using metadata categories. Instant sorting. Reliable keyboard shortcuts.

Under the hood, ULOSINO runs a Next.js application with PWA web app functionality. Our PWA libraries deliver automatic content caching and offline capability. The key ingredient here is MDX, which is based on Markdown. Together with our free licensing model, this allows anyone to contribute changes to our rich collection of OS pages. (In fact, we make it easy; open an OS and click "View on GitHub"). It also allows us to deliver performance and consistency at scale. Even though we've only programmed around 14 pages, we deploy around 150 pages. Ultimately, this leads to the faster implementation of features and bug fixes.
