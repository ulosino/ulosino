## How it works

1. Database Content is edited, in the Markdown format, as a part of a commit, and;
2. Then the new revision, with all of the Database Content is processed by the Source Code and delivered to visitors.

Read through [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

ULOSINO, as a whole stack, is divided into Database Content (`/public`) and the Source Code (`/src`), which live together on a modern Next.js application.

Contributions to the source are welcomed as well. Reference [STACK.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/STACK.md) for an overview of the ULOSINO stack.
