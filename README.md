# ULOSINO

[![ULOSINO](./public/brand/git-header.png)]()

ULOSINO is the modern setting for Unix-like operating system information. A community project, ULOSINO aims to deliver the latest and let you connect direct to culture.

Browse in speed, online or offline, anytime or anywhere. Browse in style, in light or dark modes, without distracting ads. That is the ULOSINO way.

Go to [ULOSINO.com](https://ulosino.com) now.

## How it works

1. Contributors create a commit to edit some Database Content;
2. The new package of Database Content is collected (with metadata and all) by the Source Code (at build), and;
3. Then the new build is shipped off to the user!

Go to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

ULOSINO, as a whole stack, is divided into Database Content (`/public`) and the Source Code (`/src`), which live together on a modern Next.js application.

Contributions to the source are welcomed as well. Reference [STACK.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/STACK.md) for an overview of the ULOSINO stack.
